# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **Personal Portfolio Website**! You can explore my work, skills, and contact details by visiting the website directly. [Click here to view the portfolio](https://sulav-portfolio-nu.vercel.app/).

This is a React-based personal portfolio website showcasing my introduction, experience, projects, and contact information. It is designed using React.js with a flexible navigation bar, and functionality to email directly from the site. Visitors can easily navigate through my portfolio, learn about my work, and get in touch with me.

## Features

- **Smooth Intro Transitions**: Subtle animations enhance user experience.
- **Flexible Navigation Bar**: Responsive and accessible navigation that adapts to different screen sizes. Becomes hamburger icon when scrolling down.
- **Responsive Design**: Media query currently tested on multiple screen sizes so the components adjust according to device it is viewed on. Completely changes designs in some parts instead of just becoming smaller (mainly the about component).
- **Email Functionality**: Directly send emails through the website. Email checks for valid email using regular expression.
- **Clickable Links**: Links to projects and contact methods. You can directly check the public github repositories for my projects and access my social accounts.
